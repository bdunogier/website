A Hollow Cover is the same as a [[Cover]] but has a hole so you can pass [[Cable|cables]] through it.

You can also put it on the front of an [[Importer]] or [[Exporter]] to hide part of the block.

It will let a network signal through.

Hollow covers can be removed by sneaking and right-clicking them with the [[Wrench]].
