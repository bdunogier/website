A Cover is an item used to hide [[Cable|cables]].

You can also hide blocks that have a cable on them, like the [[Importer]] or [[Exporter]].

It will block network connections, [[Cable|cables]] can't pass through the "hidden" side.

Covers can be removed by sneaking and right-clicking them with the [[Wrench]].
